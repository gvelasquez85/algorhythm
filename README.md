# Repo for Algorhythm! 

Hello Timothy!, here you will find my Coding Test!.

I felt bold and brave doing it, because it was my first time with Zurb Foundation 6 (sorry if I've made some innocent mistakes!). It was nice to learn a new Framework and I've started to think that I have too much things to learn!.

I hope we can meet again very soon!

German! :) :D
